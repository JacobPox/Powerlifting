# Powerlifting
Powerlifting data set exploration using over 300,000 competition lifts.

Using a jupyter notebook, I explore and visualize competitors and extract new features based on old ones (such as converting all the metric values and creating new tables with imperial values)

At the end of the notebook I fit the data to a model using xgboost to predict the weight of lifters based on their best competition lifts and sex. I use a couple specific cases by testing it on myself and famous powerlifter/coach Jim Wendler.
